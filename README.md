[![stars - AstroSleuth](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Aveygo/AstroSleuth?style=social)](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth)[![Python 3.9.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9.9-black.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-399/)

The (only?) free, zero bulls**t, 200 line, open source astrophotgraphy upscaler.

Sick of the commercialisation of deep space tools, I wanted a solution that can run on almost any hardware with epic results.

I started this project a regrettably long time ago. A lot has changed since then. I tried to share my work, got burned, removed it, perfected it, and fell into a well of "is it good enough".

I present my original idea, a finetuned realesr-gan model trained on 15k images of astrophotography. It is behind my works on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CodingCoda), my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHode4WV0hteze-ZDEG5atQ) attempt
and my [cloudy nights post](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/816869-astrosleuth-image-denoiser-upscaler/), and I hope it will suit you well.

## Running

### Hugging face - Good for testing/playing around
1. Go [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Aveygo/AstroSleuth). Please note that hugging face servers use 2 core cpus and you'll likely be sharing so large images may take a while, even timing out.

### Colab - Best method if you don't have a GPU 
1. Visit [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LxiNsnokF-6OmICSxWNvTeFEEZvRM2Lp?usp=sharing)
2. Enjoy!

### Locally ( Binaries ) - Recommended method
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/releases) page 
2. Download the latest zip for your platform, eg: astrosleuth-v0.1.0-windows.zip
3. Unzip and enter the folder
4. If windows, double click ```run.bat``` and follow from there

### Locally ( Binaries, continued ) - Linux/Macos
4. Set executable permissions with ```sudo chmod +x astrosleuth```
5. Run with ```./astrosleuth -n astrosleuth -i [input image path] -o [output path]```

### Locally (Python) - Fairly complicated, is the "proper" way to self-host
1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (and [pip](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows))
2. Follow the instructions on the [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) website to install pytorch.
3. Download and unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) of AstroSleuth
4. Open the terminal (right-click -> terminal) and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run the streamlit interface with ```streamlit run app.py```

## Extra information

Please see [details](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/blob/master/results/details.md) for image samples and potential workflow improvements and [training](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/blob/master/training.md) for details on how the models are trained.

## Recent changes

 - Onnx support dropped in favor of ncnn, which also makes the code simpler
 - AstroSleuthV2 is now out and comes with the binary files by default
 - Minor changes to the streamlit interface

## Known issues

Results are now more comparable with BlurXterminator after training improvements (see [training](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/blob/master/training.md)).

The biggest concern currently is the discriminator failing to detect real from fakes, regardless of it's weight on the generator. This results in AstroSleuthV2 adding a lot more stars than it should (supposably also due to the new feature model having some effect), and overall not performing to my standards. A fix is currently underway but will take a while to train/find best training parameters, and maybe needs a new discriminator altogether.

Another issue is star diffraction spikes being wavy or "spotty". A better disscriminator will help, but a dataset more focused on diffraction spikes is much more optimal. Possible synthetic dataset in the works currently.

## Concerns and Personal Notes

Its not a understatement that this tool has changed my life. It was my first machine learning project. I even built full-stack applications searching for the perfect way to share my work.
I will continue to do so. Ask for any improvements and I will likely implement them. Any feedback is appreciated, such as creating a Photoshop/Pixinsight plugin, just open a git issue [here](https://github.com/Aveygo/AstroSleuth/issues) and I'll see to it.

For the redditors, this tool is presented as is, free as long as it stays free, I cannot convey though words how much I dont care that its not "scientifically accurate".

## Support the project

Make sure to give the repo a star so that it's easier for other people to discover it!

<!---If it wasnt for https://www.rc-astro.com/ I wouldnt have built up the effort though spite to go though redeveloping this project. "Does BlurXTerminator fabricate detail? No" is full of s**t, when I got s**t for being honest and saying my model does-->
